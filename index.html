            <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a <mark>distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks)</mark>
                that
                are securely linked <del>together</del> with eachother via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
                Each
                block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally
                represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the
                transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the
                previous
                block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
                linking to
                the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are
                recorded, the
                data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

                <br><br>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
                distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and
                validate new
                transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are
                possible,
                blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high
                Byzantine
                fault tolerance.[5]</p>

            <hr>
            <P>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer
                Systems
                Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a
                cryptographically
                secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted
                to
                implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta,
                and Dave
                Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several
                document
                certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document
                certificate
                hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[13]

                <br><br>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as
                Satoshi
                Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to
                timestamp
                blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to
                stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following
                year by
                Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all
                transactions on the network.[3]

                <h2>Structure and design</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records
                    called
                    blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot
                    be altered
                    retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the
                    participants
                    to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A
                    blockchain
                    database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server.
                    They are
                    authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a
                    design
                    facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The
                    use of a
                    blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms
                    that each
                    unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A
                    blockchain has
                    been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights
                    because, when
                    properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and
                    acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>

                <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[24]</p>

                    <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification</li>
                    <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
                    <li>data (blocks, transactions</li>
                    <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable</li>
